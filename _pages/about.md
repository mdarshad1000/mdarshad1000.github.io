I am an engineering senior from New Delhi pursuing a major in Information Technology. I am a hackathon aficionado and have a keen interest in <span style="color: pink">Software Development</span> flavoured by my diagonal love for building <span style="color: pink">Natural Language Processing</span>.

I am broadly interested in Application of <span style="color: pink">Machine Learning Research</span> and <span style="color: pink">Software Development </span> with the majority of it concentrated in the field of <span style="color: pink">Backend development .</span> 

Lately I have been exploring the crazy advancements in the space of LLMs and Generative AI while tinkering with state-of-the-art frameworks like [Langchain ðŸ¦œ](https://www.langchain.com/), [LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™](https://www.llamaindex.ai/). I have also contributed to Open Source in the same.

In my spare time, I'm learning how machines learn, exploring the advancements in AGI, and hacking away on various [side projects](https://mdarshad1000.github.io/projects/). And as always, watching a healthy dose of Football.
