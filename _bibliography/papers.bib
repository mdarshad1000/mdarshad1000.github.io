  abstract = {This research explores the multifaceted challenges that can affect ventilation, air conditioning systems, and heating appliances, leading to reduced operational efficiency, heightened energy consumption, and increased maintenance expenses. Predictive maintenance, a progressive approach, is investigated as a pivotal strategy, complementing traditional HVAC equipment maintenance paradigms, including breakdown maintenance and preventative machine learning. Utilizing a diverse set of predictive models infused with machine learning techniques, this study employs the 'Semiconductor Manufacturing Process (SECOM) dataset' to simulate the manufacturing processes of HVAC systems, aligning with characteristics akin to semiconductor-based devices. The research undertakes a comparative analysis, contrasting the predictive capabilities of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in areas such as problem detection, diagnostics, and load monitoring. Notably, the RF model demonstrates superior prediction accuracy. The research aims to proactively detect potential HVAC system or component issues, discerning the nature of impending failures at their earliest stages to enable proactive maintenance strategies. Evaluation metrics such as the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and accuracy are employed for rigorous comparative analysis across various predictive machine learning classification models. Furthermore, a comprehensive 'dynamic energy performance benchmark' framework is meticulously developed for HVAC systems, facilitating real-time operational performance assessment and the identification of irregularities in power utilization at different operational stages. Additionally, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are employed to establish an administrative Model Predictive Control (MPC) system tailored for residential HVAC applications.},

  abstract = {Robots have always been at the forefront in the extent of human innovation, due to this humans are able to achieve feats that were previously only thought of as science- fiction, one such area wherein our study concentrates its attention â€“ is in the domain of Healthcare where surgery plays a massive role and is also being innovated towards improvement by including Robots. In this distinctive process of surgeries, Robots can bring about a great impact and in the Healthcare sector in general. Conventional Surgeries tend to put patients' lives in threatening situations with a process that includes a high level of risk. When the surgeries are performed, they settle the patient at the peril of developing serious infections that are fatal along with other complications such as seizures, blood clots, brain swelling, pneumonia, and hemorrhaging. A patient can develop lower blood pressure even after days or weeks of surgery and can be at the risk of experiencing a heart stroke. These risks increase with the decrease in precision and perfection in the process of surgery. Semi-autonomous procedures play a massive role in increasing precision and decreasing risks hence bringing about a revolution in the field of Advanced surgery where robots do the necessary with minimum human assistance and maximum precision utilizing advanced machine learning technology and artificial intelligence. On account of recent breakthroughs and staggering progress in the area of robotic-assisted surgeries it is safe to state that in a coming couple of decades, human intervention in surgical procedures will reach its minimum. In this paper, we will be providing significant details about the Semi- autonomous Robotic arrangement in the field of surgery which will grant a comprehensive insight into the surgical advancements of the future.},
