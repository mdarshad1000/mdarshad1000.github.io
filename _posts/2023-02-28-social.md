## Social Media - An Echo Chamber.

If you want to bring a change, you need to go beyond having conversations with people who already agree with you. The majority who need to be addressed aren't watching your Instagram stories. They don't follow you on Twitter. Most of them aren't even aware of the happenings. Start from within, and change the ones around you first before advocating to the general public.

Social media is an echo chamber, meaning we seek out information that reinforces our existing views. Change does not happen inside an echo chamber. It's time to have uncomfortable and direct conversations with the ones in question.

Cutting yourself off from the people who do not agree with you from the jump is not the solution we seek. Your "wokeness" isn't helpful if you're only using it to shame people who aren't informed. We have more to learn, we are all imperfect but growing.

Holding everyone around you to some impossible standard of wokeness might make you feel smart but won't create the change we're hoping to see. Educate yourself and most importantly gather the information that opposes your point of view. Try to understand the "other side of the story". Keep your ego aside, remove the blinkers restricting your vision, and then get going!
